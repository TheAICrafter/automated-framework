Security model
This document describes the Zero Trust security implementation for the framework.

1. Identity and authentication

Service principal authentication

Uses OAuth 2.0 client credentials flow.

Certificate-based authentication stored in Azure Key Vault.

No user credentials or connection strings embedded in client.



Runtime Session

Canvas App runs under a managed technical account to satisfy Power Apps runtime requirement.

Technical account has minimal permissions and is protected by Conditional Access policies.




2. Secret management
Azure Key Vault

Stores certificates/secrets for the service principal.

Automated secret rotation policy (e.g., 30-day rotation).

Access restricted to Azure Function via managed identity.


3. Access control
Conditional access

Applied at token issuance time.

Checks device compliance, location, and real-time risk signals.

Blocks non-compliant or risky requests.

Least Privilege Permissions

Service principal granted only necessary Graph, SharePoint, or Dataverse application permissions.

API scopes limited to data operations required by the app.




4. Audit and monitoring
Entra ID Sign-In Logs

All service principal token requests logged.

Logs include timestamp, application ID, and resource scopes.

Microsoft Purview / Sentinel

Ingests audit events for data access, token issuance, and policy enforcement.

Real-time alerting for unusual token usage or access patterns.

Retention and Reporting

Audit logs retained according to compliance requirements (e.g., 1 year).

Automated reports generated for security reviews and audits.



5. Compliance Alignment
GDPR

No personal user credentials on shared devices.

All data access events recorded with service principal identity.

HIPAA

PHI access audited end-to-end.

Technical safeguards enforced throug
