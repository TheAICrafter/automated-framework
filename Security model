🔒 Security Model
This document outlines the Zero Trust security implementation for the Automated Kiosk Authentication Framework.

1️⃣ Identity & Authentication
🔑 Service Principal Authentication

Uses OAuth 2.0 client credentials flow

Certificate-based credentials stored in Azure Key Vault

No user credentials or connection strings in client apps

🛡️ Runtime Session

Canvas App runs under a managed technical account

Technical account granted minimal permissions

Protected by Conditional Access policies

2️⃣ Secret Management
🔐 Azure Key Vault

Stores all certificates/secrets for service principals

Automated rotation policy (e.g., 30-day rotation)

Access restricted to backend service via managed identity

3️⃣ Access Control
🕹️ Conditional Access

Enforced at token issuance

Validates device compliance, location, and real-time risk signals

Blocks non-compliant or risky requests

🔒 Least-Privilege Permissions

Service principal granted only necessary API permissions

Scopes limited to required data operations (Graph, SharePoint, Dataverse)

4️⃣ Audit & Monitoring
📋 Entra ID Sign-In Logs

Logs every service principal token request

Includes timestamp, application ID, and resource scopes

🚨 Microsoft Purview / Sentinel

Ingests audit events for data access, token issuance, and policy enforcement

Real-time alerts on unusual activity or policy violations

📊 Retention & Reporting

Audit logs retained per compliance requirements (e.g., 1 year)

Automated reports generated for security reviews and audits

5️⃣ Compliance Alignment
🌍 GDPR

No personal user credentials on shared devices

All data-access events recorded under service principal identity

🏥 HIPAA

PHI access audited end-to-end

Technical safeguards via Conditional Access and secure key management

🔐 SOC 2

Continuous monitoring and evidence collection

Formal change control for secret rotation and policy updates
