🔥 Why This Changes Everything
Every organization using Power Platform hits the same wall:

Manual logins, shared credentials, and exposed PII
kill productivity, breach compliance, and invite pentests to fail.

This framework obliterates that barrier with:

Zero manual logins on any device

Zero credentials in the client

Zero PII exposure in apps

Enterprise-grade security

GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS, ISO 27001 compliance

All built on native Azure, Intune, Entra ID, and Power Platform—no external servers.

🚀 Core Innovations
Zero-Touch Device Authentication
Devices enrolled in Intune auto-authenticate—no user input ever required.

Backend Credential & PII Broker
All secrets and sensitive data operations live entirely in Azure Functions + Key Vault.

Device-Level Accountability
Every action logs DeviceID + User + Timestamp + Action—complete audit trail.

Compliance-First by Design
Pseudonymized PII, encrypted token brokering, policy-driven access, and real-time monitoring.

📈 Transformational Impact
Challenge	Outcome
Manual logins on shared devices	Eliminated
Credentials exposed in .msapp files	Zero exposure
Clear-text PII in apps/dataverse	Fully pseudonymized
BankID integration blocked by IT	Seamless, secure verification
Pentest failures from secret leaks	Pentest-ready architecture

💡 Real-World Use Cases
