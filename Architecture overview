High-level architecture overview

User Interface
A low-code front end provides the user UI. It operates under a standard service account session managed by your existing identity platform.

Integration gateway
A lightweight connector within your low-code environment routes all data requests to backend services. No secrets or credentials are stored in the front end.

Backend authentication service
A single, centralized service handles all token acquisition and renewal. It obtains and caches short-lived access tokens on behalf of the front end.

Secure secret store
Cryptographic keys and credentials are kept in a hardened, policy-enforced vault. Rotation and access policies are managed centrally, out of reach from client components.

Identity & policy enforcement
Your identity provider issues tokens only to authorized services and enforces conditional access policies. This ensures each data request meets your Zero Trust controls.

Data endpoints
All enterprise APIs (e.g. data, content, workflows) are invoked with managed service credentials. This protects user-facing components from direct API access.

Governance & audit
Every authentication and data-access event is captured in your central logging platform. Compliance, monitoring and alerting are applied without client-side dependencies.

High-level flow:
User interacts with the UI → Integration gateway forwards request → Backend auth service obtains a token → Secure secret store validates credentials → Identity provider issues service token → Data endpoint returns the response → Governance platform logs all actions
